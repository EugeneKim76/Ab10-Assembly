# 2-Nanopore
 The uncorrected ONT reads (>10Kb) were aligned (overlap) with minimap2 (v2.13;-x ava-ont -t 64), and an assembly graph (layout) was generated with miniasm (v0.3; -f <reads> <overlaps>). A consensus genome assembly was generated by mapping reads >â€‰10 Kb to the assembly with minimap2 and then running racon (v1.3.1); the consensus process was repeated three times. 
 The contig assembly was further polished using 73X PE150 Illumina sequence by first aligning the reads to the consensus assembly using minimap2 followed by running the assembly tool Pilon (v1.18) two times using 73X PE150 Illumina sequence.
